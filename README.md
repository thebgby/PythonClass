# Homework: List and Dictionary Comprehensions

## Basic Exercises

### List Comprehensions

1. **Square Numbers**

   - Write a list comprehension to create a list of squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.

2. **Even Numbers**

   - Write a list comprehension to create a list of even numbers from 1 to 20.

3. **Length of Strings**

   - Given a list of strings, use a list comprehension to create a list of their lengths.
     ```python
     words = ["hello", "world", "python", "list", "comprehension"]
     ```

4. **Uppercase Strings**

   - Write a list comprehension to convert each string in a list to uppercase.
     ```python
     fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
     ```

5. **Filtered Squares**

   - Write a list comprehension to create a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10.

6. **Flatten a List**
   - Given a list of lists, use a list comprehension to create a flat list.
     ```python
     nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
     ```

### Dictionary Comprehensions

1. **Square Numbers Dictionary**

   - Write a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 5 and the values are their squares.

2. **Length of Words**

   - Given a list of words, use a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary with the words as keys and their lengths as values.
     ```python
     words = ["hello", "world", "python", "dictionary", "comprehension"]
     ```

3. **Uppercase Words Dictionary**

   - Write a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are the words in uppercase.
     ```python
     fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
     ```

4. **Filtered Dictionary**

   - Given a dictionary of items and their prices, use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with only items that cost more than 50.
     ```python
     prices = {"apple": 30, "banana": 20, "cherry": 60, "date": 50, "fig": 70}
     ```

5. **ASCII Values**

   - Write a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where the keys are characters from 'a' to 'e' and the values are their corresponding ASCII values.

6. **Inverted Dictionary**
   - Given a dictionary, use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary where the keys and values are swapped.
     ```python
     original_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
     ```
